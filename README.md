BHO (Ball Hockey Ontario) Schedule App
================

This is a mini-app built for the players of my ball hockey team (including myself) to use for checking our game schedules.
The current website does not have an adequate mobile experience, thus I've given my team one :)

The app is hosted on Heroku at http://bho.herokuapp.com

- Ruby 2.1.2
